# ResponsivePortfolio
-Made an "About Me", "Portfolio", "Contact Me" website with 3 pages of HTML and Bootstrap.

-Used the nav bar with dark color. Aligned the links to the right of the bar and added my name to the left.

-I made a main section with a conatiner that conatined the 'About Me' portion of the page.

-Made an example portfolio with 6 thumbnails and the name under them. Couldn't figure out how to put the names on the images.

-Contact Me page was simple enough. Just put a regular form from Bootstrap and changed the names of each form. Couldn't figure out how to make the message input bigger.
